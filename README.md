### Updates
You don't need to come back here everytime you wanna check for updates... there's a specified menu for that!
![Screenshot (381)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85069997/163431946-9836a417-53b6-4cb0-b701-8408fea4e3cf.png)

There are two update channels: the Stable and the Beta.

So why don't I use only the beta you may ask, the Beta is more buggy than the Stable version... So if you wanna use this program daily, I suggest you the Stable channel. If you wanna be the first to try new features, chose the Beta!1!

### Swap versions
Didn't like the new version? Don't wait and roll back!

# Disclaimer
In order for SPOTYdl to work, I needed to use spotDL. You can access their github ![here](https://github.com/spotDL), or for some help, their Discord ![too](https://discord.gg/xCa23pwJWY)! To install it, I created the setup script, that will download all dependencies, install them and add them to path automatically!! (yeah... it's a bit annoing to do it all manually)
