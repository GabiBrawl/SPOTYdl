      + Use a separate process..?
   + In future will be used for bug removal.

________________________________V2.1________________________________ 19/06/2022
* Bug corrections & New features. (Yup, this update damaged many features)
   * Main Menu:
      * The mp3 choice would make the program die unexpectedly.
   * spotDL:
      * I realized that v3 of spotDL didn't support setting the bitrate. The command had the bitrate option and it was removed.
         * The main menu bitrate option will disappear when v3 is selected.
      x The error screens are totally bugged rn.
         x Making the notifications bugged too.
   * Settings:
      * Settings wouldn't save correctly
      $ The configuration file would get corrupted on its own.
         * Not only, but also because of the new process temporary files creation
      * When resetting the Downloads folder name, the configuration file would get some spaces that would corrupt the downloading process.
      $ Some configuration entries would get saved with "ECHO is off." instead of their corresponding values.
      * The window size was too small for the info...
   * Startup:
      * The program would fail just when trying to startup.
         * The version checking menu would just say that code was wrong, while not being it. So the feature is temporarily deprecated. The code will be available though, but inside comments. If you got it working, thank you <3
   * Version menu:
      * Changelog downloader:
         * It wouldn't go back to the version menu, instead it would go to the main menu upon download completion...
         * Now it does get downloaded into the temporary folder.
      * Channel:
         * Menu Remodel.
         * New system.

      * Added the total amount of entries of the imported file;
      * Added the value of the song that is currently downloading;
      * Added the value of the successfully downloaded songs;
      * Added the value of the failed downloading songs;
      * Estimated downloading time;
      * Corrected a bunch of bugs on all the features listed above;
      * Upon starting, it will disable the automatic computer standby time. Upon finishing the job, it will restore to 10 minutes. I didn't get a way to get the value of your current setting, so sorry for the inconvenience.
      * Now you can set an action upon the downloading completion!
         * Deprecated the computer sleep action. Refused to work for some reason...
      * When the job is finished, you'll receive a notification making the announcement, and gives you the amount of failed downloads too.
   * Correction of bugs.
      * It wouldn't list songs on other folders, non the Downloads one.
      * It wouldn't list songs if the Downloads folder was ever renamed.
      * It will now save the correct name of the failed songs into "failed_list.txt"
* On song downloading completion/failure, the program won't clear the screen. Like that you get some more info related to the problem (if ever occurs).

      x Logs get saved into "%appdata%\SPOTYdl\logs\"
   * Shows the used downloading commands, and pauses the script for better readability.
      * Don't expect that smooth app experience with debug enabled.


________________________________V2.2________________________________ 18/09/2022
* YET MORE Bug corrections (why's it so hard to exterminate bugs xD)
   * If you delete the Downloads folder while the script is running, you won't get the styled Downloads folder icon. (Fun Fact! This bug actually existed since v1.8!)
   * Repaired a glitch that would cause malfunction with directory paths containing spaces. (Fun Fact! This glitch actually existed since v1.8 too!)
* Some UI inconsistencies corrected.
* Removed a no longer needed setting within the settings menu.
* Manual audio matching feature is now available from within the main menu!
   * You match a YouTube video song link with a spotify song for it's metadata!!

      * Not yet available on all inputs. Only on the song search and manual matching menus.
* Corrected some bugs over the setup
   * Added the option to force update spotDL, but only works when online. For offline zip, you may wanna wait till the next release of the self extracting RAR file we've got for you.
* User Profiles
   * Admin control panel
      $ Can check all registered users
         $ Their corresponding passwords (if any is set)
         - Change their configurations
      - Set installation level settings (instead of per user's)
      * it's obligatory to set a password for this account.
   - Settings are going to be separated per user.
   * The user name will appear in the script's window title too.
* BSync
   * From now on, you will have an option to synchronize your songs simply with a Paired Device's Bluetooth name!!!
      * Actually, there are two. One of them being more practical, but you only get a mere estimative of how much your songs will take to transfer... The second option ain't that practical (as you gotta accept every single song you have in the target device... haven't yet figured how to go around that problem...), but nicer with realtime time remaining counter, and other nice to have ui features that aren't supported in the first method.
- Working modes are back!!
   - When setting up SPOTYdl for the first time, you can set whether you want SPOTYdl installed in portable mode, or user mode. System level installations (for all users in that device) may come later.
* Import a Recovery Flashing Command.
   - As this version is full of bugs, cause everything had to be reprogrammed while adding the new users feature, you will be able to start SPOTYdl differently with two different little commands.
      * flash
         * Resets the whole program's settings. Downloaded songs will stay intact.
            * DOESN'T WORK EITHER xD
      - recovery
         - Starts the recovery mode of SPOTYdl. There you can get some troubleshooting tools that'll help unbricking the programs's configurations.
* Version Menu
   * Added last updated date.
   * Added server version upload date.
* All the above was remade from 0 at this point...
* txt list importing:
   * Corrected a bug when using spotDL v3.
   * Changed the download screen to clear up every time a song gets downloaded. More pretty!
   * Corrected a glitch that if an incorrect input is set it would start the download process.
   * Corrected a bug that wouldn't make the upon completion selection feature work...
   * Removed the success and failure info when downloading songs when using spotDL v3. v3 doesn't have errorlevels.
* Rephrased the about SPOTYdl text, to be consistent in phrase sizing. Hard work, but accomplishable!

   * Added a quote to inform about the removal of any special characters in the input.
* Version upgrade:
   * Removed the window spam when updating SPOTYdl. The whole process is now hidden. (Not meaning that you could see anything before lol)
