--------------------V0.1-------------------- 25/02/2022
               INITIAL RELEASE
You'll experience many bugs(yeah, so many that I'm uploading it now, for help... pls?), but you can already chose the final music format and download normally.
You'll ALWAYS receive notifications as failed, don't worry, most of the times it didn't, its just a bug with %errorlevel%...
SETUP (NOT TESTED): you won't be able to use this without running the setup file first (if it's not working, open the setup file, and download the files in the links and then install them. You'll need to run some commands too...)
